ü§ñ LLM Tools Used
Claude AI (Primary Assistant)
Architecture Design: Component structure, API endpoints
Code Generation: React components, backend routes
Problem Solving: Quiz generation logic, RAG implementation
Debugging: Error handling, API integration issues
Documentation: README, inline comments
GitHub Copilot
Code Completion: Faster function writing
Boilerplate: Repetitive UI components
Quick Fixes: Syntax corrections, imports
ChatGPT
Research: Best practices for RAG, vector databases

Troubleshooting: Specific library issues
‚ú® Key Decisions & Trade-offs
1. Vector Database Choice
Decision: ChromaDB Reason:
Lightweight, no separate server needed
Built-in embeddings support
Perfect for local development Alternative: Pinecone (cloud-based, more scalable)
2. AI Model Selection
Decision: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Reason:
Free tier with 15 req/min
No credit card required
Fast response times
Good quality for educational content Alternative: OpenAI GPT-4 (better quality, but paid)
3. Storage Strategy
Decision: localStorage (client-side) Reason:
No backend database setup needed
Fast development
Sufficient for MVP Trade-off: Data lost on cache clear Future: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for production
4. Question Types
Decision: Focus on MCQs only Reason:
Time constraint
Easier to auto-grade
Clear scoring system Missing: SAQs and LAQs (mentioned in requirements) Reason: Would need separate grading logic, more complex UI
5. YouTube Integration
Decision: Search URLs instead of embedded videos Reason:
No YouTube API key needed
Faster implementation
Users prefer full YouTube interface Alternative: YouTube Data API v3 (requires API key)
üé® UI/UX Highlights
Modern Design: Gradient headers, rounded corners, shadows
Color Coding:
Green for strong performance (‚â•80%)
Yellow for average (60-79%)
Red for needs improvement (<60%)
Intuitive Navigation: Clear icons, descriptive labels
Feedback: Loading states, success messages, error handling
Accessibility: Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation
üìä What's Working Well
